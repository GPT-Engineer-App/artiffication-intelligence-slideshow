# The Origins of Artificial Intelligence

---

## The Beginnings of AI

- Early concepts of artificial beings in mythology and literature
- Formal reasoning and logic as precursors to AI
- The idea of "thinking machines" emerges

---

## Alan Turing and The Turing Test

- Alan Turing's seminal paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950)
- The Turing Test: Can machines think?
- Laying the groundwork for AI research

---

## The Dartmouth Conference: Birth of AI as a Field

- Summer of 1956: The Dartmouth Conference
- Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence"
- Attendees included John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others
- Marked the official beginning of AI research

---

## Early AI Programs

- Logic Theorist (1955): First AI program by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon
- General Problem Solver (1957): Improved version focusing on general problem-solving
- Demonstrated the potential of AI in tackling complex tasks

---

## The AI Winter

- Period of reduced funding and interest in AI research
- Overpromising and underdelivering led to skepticism
- Challenges in scaling early successes to more complex problems
- Lasted from the 1970s to the 1980s

---

## Expert Systems: Rise of Knowledge-Based Systems

- 1980s: Resurgence of AI through expert systems
- Programs designed to solve complex problems by mimicking human expertise
- Applied in fields like medicine, engineering, and finance
- Limitations eventually led to another AI winter

---

## Machine Learning: The Advent of Learning Algorithms

- Shift from rule-based systems to data-driven approaches
- Development of algorithms that improve with experience
- Key techniques: Decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines
- Enabled AI to tackle problems too complex for explicit programming

---

## Deep Learning: The Neural Network Revolution

- Resurgence of neural networks with deep learning
- Breakthroughs in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing
- Enabled by increased computing power and big data
- Key milestones: AlexNet (2012), DeepMind's AlphaGo (2016)

## AI in the 21st Century

- Integration of AI into everyday technology
- Advancements in natural language processing (e.g., GPT models)
- AI ethics and responsible AI development
- The ongoing quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
